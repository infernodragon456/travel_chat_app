## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- npm, yarn, or pnpm

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vighnesh-007/travel_chat_app.git
cd travel_chat_app
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set up environment variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project and add your Groq API key:

```.env.local
GROQ_API_KEY="YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY_HERE"
```

You can get a free API key from the [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/keys).

### 4. Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The application is a monolithic Next.js app.

1.  **Client (Browser)**: The user clicks the microphone button. The Web Speech API listens for voice input in the selected language.
2.  **Geolocation**: Upon successful transcription, the browser's Geolocation API fetches the user's coordinates.
3.  **API Request**: The frontend sends the transcribed text, coordinates, and locale to a Next.js API Route (`/api/getSuggestion`).
4.  **Server (Vercel Function)**:
    a. The API route fetches real-time weather data from Open-Meteo.
    b. It constructs a detailed system prompt containing the weather data and the user's query.
    c. It sends this prompt to the Groq API using the Vercel AI SDK.
5.  **Streaming Response**: The server streams the LLM's response back to the client.
6.  **Text-to-Speech**: The frontend displays the streaming text. Once complete, it uses the Web Speech API to read the text aloud in the appropriate language.
